# Ex 7.2.2-7 #

(a) 2 tests p<sub>2</sub> and p<sub>3</sub> are test path. Other are not because:

- p<sub>1</sub> does not terminate at a final node.
- p<sub>4</sub> does not start at an initial node.
- p<sub>5</sub> includes an edge that does not exist in the graph (3,2).

(b)  8 test requirements for Edge-Pair Coverage (only the length two subpaths):
 [1,2,1], [1,2,3], [1,3,1], [2,1,2], [2,1,3], [2,3,1], [3,1,2], [3,1,3]

(c) Non of them. Both don't have [2,1,2] and [3,1,3]

(d) The path p<sub>3</sub> tour the prime path with sidestrip [1,2,1].
