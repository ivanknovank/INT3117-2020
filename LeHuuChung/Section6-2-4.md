# Ex 6.2.4

## a)

I think this partition maybe missing the case where s1 has only one element but it is null or one or many of the elements is null.

## b)

Yes it satisfies the disjointness property.

## c)

The relation misses the obvious case where s1 and s2 partly intersect, for example the sets {1,2,3,4} and {3,4,5,6}. 

## d)

When both s1 and s2 are empty sets, they both represent the same set and stil does not have anything elements in common. This violates the disjointness property.

## e)

3! + 4!

## f)

Validity of s1:

- s1 = null
- s1 = {}
- s1 = {null}
- s1 = {one element other than null}
- s1 = {many elements beside null}
- s1 = {mix between normal elements and null}

Relation between s1 and s2:
- they are both null
- they are both empty
- they both contain one element which is null
- they represent the same set of one or many elements different from null
- they represent the same mixed set of normal elements and null
- s1 is a subset of s2
- s2 is a subset of s1
- s1 and s2 have many elements and intersect at normal values or null
- s1 and s2 does not have anything in common
