# Ex6-3

## a)

If the list has only one element, the element is both the first and the last entry. This violates the disjointness property.

## b)

It fails the completeness property because it lacks the case where the element is not in the list.

## c)

Block 1: element is not in the list

Block 2: element is the only element in the list

Block 3: element is the first element in a list with length bigger than 2

Block 4: element is the last element in a list with length bigger than 2

Block 3: element is an "inbetween" element in a list with length bigger than 3
