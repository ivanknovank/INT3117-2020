4.	Answer the following questions for the method intersection() below:
 

a)	Does the partition “Validity of s1” satisfy the completeness property? If not, give a value for s1 that does not fit in any block.

-	Yes, the partition validity of Set s1 satisfies the completeness property as Set s1 can either be null or empty or has at least 1 element in it. The given value to S1 only satisfy one of three conditions and none S1 value dissatisfy all.
 
b)	Does the partition “Validity of s1” satisfy the disjointness property? If not, give a value for s1 that fits in more than one block.

-	Yes, the partition validity of Set s1 satisfies the disjointness property. There is no S1 value that qualified for more than 1 condition. The values will either give a null set, an empty set or a set with at least 1 element in it. The value cannot fit in more than 1 partition.

c)	Does the partition “Relation between s1 and s2” satisfy the completeness property? If not, give a pair of values for s1 and s2 that does not fit in any block.

-	Yes, it displays the completeness, if s1,s2 are not null sets then there can't be any condition outside the given four.

d)	Does the partition “Relation between s1 and s2” satisfy the disjointness property? If not, give a pair of values for s1 and s2 that fits in more than one block.

-	No, it doesn't display the disjointness property as when s1= {} and s2={} i.e. both sets are empty will one consider the condition s1 & s2 represent the same set or the condition that s1 & s2 do not have any elements in common.
