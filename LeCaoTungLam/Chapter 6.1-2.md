2.	A tester defined three characteristics based on the input parameter car: Where Made, Energy Source, and Size. The following partitionings for these characteristics have at least two mistakes. Correct them.

						Where Made
					North America	Europe	Asia
						Energy Source
					gas	electric	hybrid
						Size
					2-door	4-door	hatch back

	-	Where Made is not complete. Add “other”
	-	Size overlaps, a hatch-back could be 2-door or 4-door. Either add “2-door + hatch-back,” and “4-door + hatch-back,” or create two new characteristics:
	-	Side Doors: 2, 4
	-	Hatch-back: yes, no
