# Use the method `printPrimes()` for questions aâ€“f below. A compilable version is available on the book website in the file PrintPrimes.java. A line-numbered version suitable for this exercise is available on the book website in the file PrintPrimes.num.
* (a) Draw the control flow graph for the `printPrimes()` method.
* (b) Consider test cases t1 = (n = 3) and t2 = (n = 5). Although these tour the same prime paths in `printPrimes()`, they do not necessarily find the same faults. Design a simple fault that t2 would be more likely to discover than t1 would.
* (c) For `printPrimes()`, find a test case such that the corresponding test path visits the edge that connects the beginning of the while statement to the for statement without going through the body of the while loop.
* (d) List the test requirements for Node Coverage, Edge Coverage, and Prime Path Coverage.
* (e) List test paths that achieve Node Coverage but not Edge
Coverage on the graph.
* (f) List test paths that achieve Edge Coverage but not Prime Path Coverage on the graph.
